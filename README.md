# Agentic Scaffolding Demonstration

This project demonstrates the concept of Agentic Scaffolding in AI Agent Ecosystems. It provides a practical implementation of the theoretical framework described in "An Algorithmic Framework for Agentic Scaffolding in AI Agent Ecosystems."

## What is Agentic Scaffolding?

Agentic Scaffolding is a meta-system or architectural layer designed to support, coordinate, and enhance the capabilities of individual AI agents or multi-agent systems within an ecosystem. It provides the necessary structure, services, and environment that facilitate the achievement of complex, high-level goals which might be beyond the capacity of individual agents operating in isolation.

## Key Components

The implementation includes the following key components of Agentic Scaffolding:

1. **Goal and Task Decomposition**: Breaking down complex goals into manageable subtasks
2. **Planning and Sequencing**: Determining the optimal order of execution for subtasks
3. **Dynamic Coordination**: Allocating tasks to appropriate agents and monitoring progress
4. **Resource Management**: Providing access to knowledge bases, tools, and APIs
5. **Communication**: Enabling standardized interaction between agents

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Virtual environment (recommended)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/Scripts/activate  # On Windows
   # OR
   source venv/bin/activate      # On Unix/MacOS
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Set up environment variables:
   - Create a `.env` file in the project root
   - Add your OpenAI API key (if using OpenAI):
     ```
     OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
     ```

### Running the Application

1. Start the Flask application:
   ```
   python app.py
   ```
2. Open your browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000`

## Usage

1. Enter a high-level goal in the input field (e.g., "Analyze the impact of artificial intelligence on healthcare over the next decade")
2. Submit the goal
3. Watch as the system:
   - Decomposes the goal into subtasks
   - Creates an execution plan
   - Allocates tasks to specialized agents
   - Executes the plan
   - Presents the results

## Implementation Notes

- For demonstration purposes, this implementation uses a mock LLM client that simulates responses. In a production environment, you would use a real LLM service like OpenAI's GPT models.
- The execution flow is simplified for clarity. A production system would include more robust error handling, retry mechanisms, and adaptive planning.
- The web interface visualizes the key components and processes of Agentic Scaffolding to make the concept more tangible.
